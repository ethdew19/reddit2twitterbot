# reddit2twitterbot
This program will look at the top posts on a given subreddit, and if the post isn't stickied and has an image file attached to it, will post it on twitter. 
It first checks your last tweet to see if they are the same, this could cause issues if you have multiple bots running on the same twitter account. 
For reddit api access I used PRAW and for twitter I used tweepy.
